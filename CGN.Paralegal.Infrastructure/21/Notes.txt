===============================================================================================================================
Cleanup TODO:

C:\EV_DEV\Infrastructure\EvLog.cs should eventually be refactored away. In the meanwhile its implementation is changed to redirect to Tracer.

ELMAH should be removed from 1. DB; 2. Configuration files; 3. checked in binaries;

Obsolete log tables (everything in EvLogs except NLog table) should be dropped from DB.

Every access to Exception.Message ("ex.Message") property need to be looked at (there are about 150 of them). Typically it should be replaced with
.ToDebugString(), but variations are possible, depending on how this message is using.

Methods and properties marked with //[Obsolete] or         /// <summary>  /// DEPRECATED! DO NOT USE!  /// </summary>
supposed to be refactored out. They are temporary patched to redirect to the code they should be replaced with.
